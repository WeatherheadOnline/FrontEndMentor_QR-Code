## Overview

This was the first project in FrontEndMentor.io's onboarding leaning path. It was a simple project, making it easier for me to focus on getting familiar with using Figma. I was surprised to not have to make any changes to the CSS to accommodate both desktop and mobile.

## My process

Looking at the design file, I could see the page divided up into sections: a white box containing an image, some header text, and some paragraph text. I created these elements, nesting the latter three inside the white box. After that, I plugged in the font sizes, colors and spacing from the design files, using margins and padding as needed for spacing.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learned to use Figma, both to view the project mockups and to extract properties such as colors, fonts and spacing. This project also provided me with a refresher on using Google fonts.

### Continued development

I look forward to gaining more experience with Figma and learning to use its tools and features.
